# Cuebooker living handoff

Updated: 17 September 2026  
Branch: `feature/app-visual-system`  
Status: ACTIVE BATON PASS

Read this immediately after `AGENTS.md`. This document records current implementation truth, not aspirations. Always query live branch HEAD before modifying code.

## 1. Product truth

Cuebooker manages booking demand that an artist, manager or agency already receives. It does not promise to find gigs.

All ingress mechanisms converge into the same Booking Core. Never create separate inboxes or booking models per channel.

```text
+CUE / public Artist Profile / widget / email import / future smart capture
 -> Contact / Counterparty
 -> Booking
 -> Activity
 -> Next Move
 -> Hold
 -> Overview attention
 -> Calendar projection
 -> History
```

The public-entry product direction is capability-driven rather than screen-driven:

```text
Input
 -> Normalize
 -> Interpret
 -> Validate
 -> Confirm
 -> Booking Core
 -> Activity
 -> Notify
```

Future voice/text/WhatsApp/email capture must reuse this pipeline rather than create parallel booking models.

## 2. Canonical public product

Canonical public identity:

```text
cuebooker.com/<artist-slug>
```

Attributed deep-link example:

```text
/<artist-slug>?booking=1&src=instagram
```

The authenticated Profile preview and public visitor profile reuse the same `PublicArtistProfile` component. Do not reintroduce a separate bespoke preview.

The public Artist Profile is intended to become the artist's professional public landing surface, with booking as a capability inside it rather than a disconnected cold form.

Promoters do not need a Cuebooker account.

Publication controls remain separate:

```text
Perfil publicado / privado
Aceptar solicitudes / booking cerrado
```

Private booking terms, fee thresholds, contacts, internal notes, negotiation history, holds, Next Moves and private calendar data stay outside the public profile contract.

## 3. Provenance semantics

Keep separate:

```text
origin_channel  = where the opportunity/conversation originated
capture_method  = how it entered Cuebooker
entry_source    = public-link/form attribution when known
```

Example:

```text
Instagram bio -> public form
origin_channel = booking_form
capture_method = public_form
entry_source = instagram
```

Do not overload `origin_channel` with referral attribution.

## 4. Public-ingress foundation — STAGING ONLY

Supabase staging:

```text
cuebooker-staging
project: lycprjeuuynfzwskycwv
```

Applied/versioned public-ingress migrations:

```text
20260917113205_add_public_booking_ingress_foundation.sql
20260917113340_harden_public_booking_submission_rls.sql
20260917113403_index_public_booking_ingress_foreign_keys.sql
20260917114038_reserve_public_artist_slugs.sql
20260917123613_add_public_booking_follow_up.sql
20260917123841_allow_system_origin_inbound_email_threads.sql
```

Real public-ingress smoke proved:

```text
Public Artist Profile
 -> Booking Form
 -> submit-booking-request
 -> create_public_booking
 -> Contact / Counterparty
 -> Booking(status=new)
 -> inbound Activity
 -> authenticated Booking Core
```

Idempotent retry with the same request ID returns the same Booking rather than duplicating it.

Expected provenance was verified:

```text
status = new
origin_channel = booking_form
capture_method = public_form
entry_source = website / instagram depending link
created_by = null
```

## 5. Public Booking Form V2 — IMPLEMENTED / PR PREVIEW

Functional implementation culminated at:

```text
cd54704b6aec843017252ce06b12f311aca7d30a
```

Files:

```text
app/components/PublicBookingForm.vue
app/components/PublicArtistProfile.vue
app/components/PublicBookingWidget.vue
app/pages/[slug].vue
```

Implemented behavior:

- native date/calendar input;
- malformed/past/unreasonably-future dates blocked client-side;
- 10-year future guardrail prevents accidental years such as `12026` reaching backend;
- inline validation for required name/email/proposal plus country/date/offer/currency;
- optional details auto-open when first invalid field lives there;
- focus moves to first invalid field;
- `aria-invalid` / `aria-describedby` relationships;
- form data preserved after backend failure;
- technical API errors translated into promoter-facing messages;
- success state distinguishes saved + confirmation email sent from saved + email delivery unavailable;
- public Booking reference surfaced when returned;
- same behavior shared by public profile and widget.

Validation:

```text
CI run 35276181812: tests + production build success
Deploy run 35276181813: PR preview success
```

Visual/mobile smoke of field-level states is still required before calling V2 UX fully closed.

## 6. Secure promoter follow-up — PROVEN ON STAGING

Product rule:

- secure link lets a promoter read a safe booking summary/status/conversation and reply;
- promoter cannot mutate internal `Booking.status`;
- external reply becomes inbound Activity in the same Booking Core;
- there is no second promoter booking model.

`public_booking_follow_up_access` stores only the SHA-256 hash of the secure bearer token. The raw token is not persisted in Booking Core, Activity or stored email body.

`/request?token=...` is the real promoter follow-up surface.

A real staging smoke proved:

```text
public form
 -> real Booking
 -> Brevo acknowledgement email
 -> secure follow-up link
 -> promoter reply on /request
 -> inbound Activity on same Booking
```

Observed Activity thread contained the initial public-form message, outbound acknowledgement email and secure-link inbound promoter reply.

## 7. Acknowledgement email — PROVEN ON STAGING

Staging has a working Brevo API key for `submit-booking-request`.

A real delivery smoke succeeded:

```text
email_messages.status = sent
provider = brevo
failure_code = null
from_email = bookings@cuebooker.com
provider_message_id = Brevo SMTP relay message id
```

Semantics:

- acknowledgement is system-origin with `created_by = null`;
- `purpose = public_acknowledgement`;
- provider failure never rolls back Booking;
- secure follow-up token is random 256-bit and only its hash persists;
- raw secure URL exists only in provider payload memory;
- Reply-To uses `booking+<reply_token>@reply.cuebooker.com`.

## 8. Direct email reply — PARTIALLY PROVEN, ONE GATE OPEN

Proven:

```text
Cuebooker acknowledgement
 -> Reply-To booking+<uuid>@reply.cuebooker.com
 -> Gmail sends to exact recipient
 -> Brevo inbound receives message
 -> Brevo marks received
 -> Brevo marks processed
```

Observed Brevo path then ends with:

```text
received -> processed -> webhookFailed
```

Inbound webhook:

```text
type = inbound
event = inboundEmailProcessed
domain = reply.cuebooker.com
endpoint = https://lycprjeuuynfzwskycwv.supabase.co/functions/v1/ingest-booking-email
header = x-cuebooker-webhook-secret
```

`reply.cuebooker.com` and Gmail/MX are therefore not the current investigation target. `ingest-booking-email` is ACTIVE and currently deployed with `verify_jwt = false`.

Exact next diagnostic when terminal access is available:

```text
1. use one webhook secret;
2. set exact same value in Supabase staging as CUEBOOKER_INBOUND_WEBHOOK_SECRET;
3. set same value in Brevo x-cuebooker-webhook-secret header;
4. POST directly to ingest-booking-email with {"items":[]};
5. expected: {"accepted":0,"ignored":0};
6. only then send a fresh Gmail reply and verify inbound email_messages + Activity.
```

Do not keep re-sending direct email replies before the handshake test passes.

Rotate exposed setup secrets before production readiness.

## 9. Distribution / Share UX — IMPLEMENTED ON BRANCH / PR PREVIEW

Latest functional commit:

```text
c336ebd946c9709f59524419fa3648471f3b0598
```

File:

```text
app/components/PublicProfilePublishingControls.vue
```

The previous technical wall of URLs has been replaced with use-case-driven distribution cards grouped as:

```text
Perfil
Solicitudes directas
Tu web
```

Current supported entry surfaces in the UI:

- public profile;
- direct booking;
- Instagram;
- WhatsApp Business;
- email;
- EPK;
- link-in-bio;
- QR-attributed link;
- website link;
- iframe widget code.

Each card explains where/why to use the entry point and shows attribution semantics rather than exposing a raw URL as the primary UX. Copy actions remain explicit (`Copiar enlace` / `Copiar código`). All attributed links still converge into the same public intake contract and preserve `entry_source`.

Important: the QR card currently copies a QR-attributed URL only. Actual QR image generation remains a separate future slice and is not falsely presented as implemented.

Validation:

```text
CI run 35277735399: tests + production build success
Deploy run 35277734983: PR preview success
```

Visual/mobile review of the expanded distribution panel is still required.

## 10. Inbound email observability foundation — IMPLEMENTED ON BRANCH

Operational hardening commits:

```text
b79af6c4785434721a270380ab2fc30165a36c11
4b3c5842294e1362190fdf6d04fc6249b998c0b0
```

Changes:

- `supabase/config.toml` now explicitly versions `[functions.ingest-booking-email] verify_jwt = false`, matching the deployed staging contract so future deploys do not depend on dashboard-only state;
- every inbound webhook invocation receives a Cuebooker request/correlation ID;
- responses expose that ID through `x-cuebooker-request-id` and response JSON;
- structured JSON log events distinguish method rejection, missing configuration, webhook auth failure, invalid JSON, empty batch, ignored-item reasons, accepted items, completed batch and failed batch;
- ignored reasons are explicit without logging message bodies, email addresses, webhook secrets or other high-risk payload content;
- accepted Activity metadata records `ingest_request_id` so future admin/support tooling can correlate a stored booking event with Edge Function logs;
- errors still return promoter/provider-safe codes while technical detail remains server-side.

Validation:

```text
CI run 35278941346: tests + production build success
Deploy/preview run 35278941375: preview build success; Cloudflare PR deployment initiated from same commit
```

This improves diagnosability of the existing inbound flow but does not replace the pending direct webhook-secret handshake. Production remains untouched.

## 11. Notification foundation — IMPLEMENTED ON STAGING

Migration / functional commit:

```text
485dd6dd624fc0d34417ecd8bca8ec517f086ca7
supabase/migrations/20260917232000_add_notification_foundation.sql
```

Staging migration applied successfully to:

```text
lycprjeuuynfzwskycwv
```

Current model:

- `public.notifications` is the shared user-facing notification event stream;
- current event kinds are `booking_request_received` and `promoter_reply_received`;
- one notification row is created per eligible workspace member (`owner/admin/manager/editor`), excluding passive `viewer` members;
- dedupe is enforced per workspace + recipient + event key;
- notifications reference the Booking and optional Activity instead of copying conversation content;
- metadata carries structured context only;
- RLS allows a signed-in user to read only their own notifications;
- authenticated clients receive only `SELECT` plus column-level `UPDATE(read_at)`, so notification identity/content cannot be rewritten by the browser;
- indexes cover recipient timeline, unread recipient timeline and booking lookup.

Automatic creation now happens at the domain boundary:

```text
new public_form Booking
 -> booking_request_received

external inbound Activity
 ingested_by = public_follow_up | brevo_inbound
 -> promoter_reply_received
```

The initial public-form Activity does not create a duplicate reply notification.

Validation:

```text
CI run 35279648215: success
Deploy Staging run 35279648389: success
staging RLS: enabled
recipient SELECT/UPDATE policies: present
recipient/unread/booking indexes: present
booking + external-reply triggers: present
```

No fake Booking was created solely for this validation. The next real public booking or promoter reply will exercise the triggers naturally.

This is intentionally channel-neutral. Email delivery, in-product notification center and future Web Push should consume this same notification event model rather than create separate booking logic.

## 12. Notification email templates + delivery queue — IMPLEMENTED ON STAGING

Functional commits:

```text
9862c9c7ac448fce9cfbe4c8b5370301dc2e6cc9
cd1de87b82893d115396d735fca91b03ea59150d
153bf42c3206877707f350e757ba7242c2358e39
```

Files:

```text
supabase/migrations/20260917234500_add_notification_email_delivery_queue.sql
supabase/functions/_shared/notificationEmailTemplates.ts
tests/notificationEmailTemplates.test.ts
```

Staging migration applied successfully to `lycprjeuuynfzwskycwv`.

Delivery model:

- notification events and email delivery attempts are separate records;
- every new notification automatically enqueues one `notification_email_deliveries` row;
- delivery state supports `queued / processing / sent / failed`;
- attempts, provider IDs, error code, retry timestamp and sent/failed timestamps are tracked;
- one delivery row per notification prevents retry duplication;
- queue indexes support ready/retry scans and recipient diagnostics;
- the queue is service-role-only; no browser RLS policy exposes operational delivery state.

Template layer:

- two initial templates: `booking_request_received` and `promoter_reply_received`;
- ES/EN copy;
- subject + preheader + plain-text fallback + branded HTML;
- contextual artist/contact/event/venue/city/date values;
- CTA points back to the Booking rather than reproducing the conversation;
- dynamic HTML content is escaped;
- promoter message body is intentionally not copied into notification email templates.

Current visual language is deliberately restrained: dark Cuebooker shell, lime accent, one clear CTA, short contextual copy.

Validation:

```text
CI run 35281897382: tests + production build success
notification template unit tests: success
staging queue RLS: enabled
notifications_enqueue_email_delivery trigger: present
ready + recipient queue indexes: present
```

No delivery dispatcher/cron is wired yet, so queued rows are not claimed/sent automatically in this slice. The next backend step is an idempotent dispatcher that resolves recipient email + Booking context, renders these templates, sends through Brevo and updates the delivery row. Do not send directly from the notification trigger.

## 13. Notification email dispatcher — IMPLEMENTED ON STAGING

Functional commits:

```text
5fad91b84d7dbb98b7e0e0c6c081d2e2a31a7e5d

```

Files:

```text
supabase/migrations/20260918003000_add_notification_email_claim.sql
supabase/functions/dispatch-notification-emails/index.ts
supabase/config.toml
app/pages/workspace.vue
```

Staging state:

- service-role-only `claim_notification_email_deliveries(batch_size)` uses `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`;
- jobs can be reclaimed after 15 minutes in stale `processing`;
- max delivery attempts = 5;
- retry backoff is handled by dispatcher;
- Brevo delivery writes provider message ID and `sent/failed` operational state;
- recipient email is resolved from Supabase Auth server-side;
- recipient display name comes from `profiles`;
- booking/artist/contact/counterparty context is resolved server-side;
- email locale currently reads Auth metadata when present and otherwise falls back to ES;
- dispatcher never accepts arbitrary recipient/content from the caller;
- dispatcher endpoint requires the existing service-role bearer token in function code even though Supabase JWT gateway verification is disabled;
- `dispatch-notification-emails` is ACTIVE on staging, version 1;
- `supabase/config.toml` versions `verify_jwt = false` because custom service-role authentication happens inside the function.

Booking CTA deep-link support was added:

```text
/workspace?artist=<artist-id>&booking=<booking-id>
```

The workspace now honors both query params, selects the requested artist when accessible and opens the real Booking after Booking Core has loaded.

Validation:

```text
Edge Function deployment: ACTIVE v1
CI run 35283306204: tests + production build success
Deploy Staging / PR preview run 35283306104: success
processing/ready/recipient delivery indexes: present on staging
```

Automatic first-attempt activation is now wired server-to-server from the existing ingress Edge Functions:

- `submit-booking-request` dispatches only when a new public Booking was actually created;
- `booking-follow-up` dispatches only when a new external follow-up Activity was actually created;
- `ingest-booking-email` dispatches only when at least one inbound email item was accepted;
- each invocation authenticates to `dispatch-notification-emails` with the already-existing service-role secret held in Edge Function environment;
- calls run through `EdgeRuntime.waitUntil`, so promoter-facing responses are not blocked by notification email delivery;
- idempotent retries that do not create a new domain event do not trigger duplicate notification sends.

Deployment state:

```text
submit-booking-request ACTIVE v14
booking-follow-up ACTIVE v13
ingest-booking-email ACTIVE v15
dispatch-notification-emails ACTIVE v1
```

Validation:

```text
CI run 35284305515: tests + production build success
```

Periodic retry draining is now enabled on staging without persisting service-role or Brevo credentials in cron SQL.

Implementation:

- `pg_cron` + `pg_net` enabled on staging;
- cron job `cuebooker-notification-email-retry` runs every 5 minutes;
- each cron invocation generates a 256-bit one-time token through `private.issue_notification_dispatch_token()`;
- only the SHA-256 hash is stored in `private.notification_dispatch_tokens`;
- tokens expire after 2 minutes and are single-use;
- the dispatcher accepts either internal service-role authentication or a valid one-time scheduler token;
- token validation happens through service-role-only `consume_notification_dispatch_token()`;
- no service-role JWT, Brevo key or long-lived dispatcher secret is stored in the cron command.

Security note: `consume_notification_dispatch_token()` is `SECURITY DEFINER` because `service_role` intentionally has no direct access to the private token table; EXECUTE remains granted only to `service_role`.

Staging smoke:

```text
manual pg_net scheduler request -> HTTP 200
dispatcher response -> {"claimed":0,"sent":0,"failed":0}
cron job active -> */5 * * * *
```

The earlier scheduler-auth 403 was traced to the private-table permission boundary and fixed in migration `20260918012000_fix_scheduler_token_consume_permissions.sql`.

## 14. Notification read API foundation — IMPLEMENTED ON BRANCH

Functional commits:

```text
18c10ad32a235b4028c55c7cdeec724f631fa6d0
0285611c4ad4083e1bcf6d69fa7bfa3f5add5aa3
a6914dcfee527cf6e5c0a8f438b3825408e4cf2c
```

Files:

```text
app/domain/notification.ts
app/services/notificationApi.ts
app/composables/useNotifications.ts
```

Available client operations, all relying on existing notification RLS:

- list recent notifications;
- exact unread count through PostgREST count semantics;
- mark one notification as read;
- mark all visible unread notifications as read.

The browser does not receive delivery-queue access and cannot mutate notification identity/content. The existing column-level `UPDATE(read_at)` grant remains the only client-side notification mutation.

No notification-center UI was introduced in this slice. The intent is to make the future bell/panel a thin presentation layer over an already-defined domain/API contract.

Validation at time of handoff update:

```text
CI run 35284465373: tests success; production build running
PR preview run 35284465308: preview build success; deploy running
```

## 15. Notification delivery E2E + notification center — IMPLEMENTED ON STAGING / BRANCH

Additional functional commits:

```text
72080374718db2971933aa9d87ca5831b1b49a94
805eae97674d1b9c431466868d5ae51d8c94b533
5da673a870506a0c853b4c5dd1b1bdd2975276c7
```

### Delivery smoke

A real existing staging Booking was reused for an explicitly marked notification smoke instead of creating another fake Booking.

Smoke notification:

```text
booking_id: 214d912e-f4f1-414f-9d8d-eda2f50be115
kind: booking_request_received
metadata.smoke_test: true
recipient: workspace owner
```

The first dispatcher attempt exposed missing service-role SELECT grants on `notifications` and `profiles`:

```text
claimed=1
sent=0
failed=1
last_error_code=supabase_403
```

Migration `20260918013500_grant_notification_dispatch_context.sql` grants only the server-side reads required for delivery. Browser RLS/grants are unchanged.

Retry smoke after the migration:

```text
dispatcher HTTP 200
claimed=1
sent=1
failed=0
provider=brevo
provider_message_id=<202609172309.81894022181@smtp-relay.mailin.fr>
attempts=2
```

The periodic cron itself is also running successfully on staging at 5-minute intervals.

Scheduler configuration is now versioned through `private.configure_notification_email_retry(dispatch_url, schedule)` in migration `20260918015000_add_notification_retry_configurator.sql`. The shared migration never hard-codes a staging URL; each environment installs the same job with its own dispatcher endpoint. Staging has been reconfigured through this function and currently uses job id 2.

### Notification center

A first functional notification-center UI now exists on the branch:

```text
app/components/WorkspaceNotifications.vue
```

It is integrated into the workspace header and uses the existing RLS-backed notification API.

Current behavior:

- bell icon with unread badge;
- recent-notification list;
- distinct copy for new booking vs promoter reply;
- read/unread state;
- mark one as read by opening it;
- mark all as read;
- notification click resolves the Booking, switches artist when needed, opens the real Booking view and persists `artist` + `booking` query params;
- desktop uses an anchored panel;
- mobile uses a vertical bottom sheet rather than a horizontal notification rail;
- Escape/outside-click closes the panel;
- inline SVG only, no emoji/icon inconsistency.

Visual desktop/mobile smoke is still required before considering the notification-center presentation final.

Current smoke notification is intentionally left unread on staging so the bell badge and notification-center read flow can be visually verified without creating another test event.

## 16. Pricing / monetization direction — HYPOTHESIS, NOT IMPLEMENTED

Current launch hypothesis:

```text
30-day free trial
 -> one simple Solo plan around €15/month as an initial/founder price
 -> core booking workflow + public profile + links + widget + notifications included
```

Do not split Instagram links, WhatsApp links, widget or public profile into separate paid add-ons at launch. These are acquisition/distribution surfaces that increase the value of the same booking engine.

A future Manager/Agency plan can be priced around workspace/roster/artist scale once real usage data exists.

AI/voice limits should not be hard-coded into pricing before real usage/cost evidence exists.

No billing, trial enforcement or Stripe integration is implemented yet.

## 17. Product direction captured, NOT FOR IMMEDIATE PARALLEL IMPLEMENTATION

### Smart Capture / interpretation

Voice and free text should become one Capture Engine rather than separate novelty features.

Future inputs may include typed free text, dictated voice, pasted WhatsApp text and pasted/imported email.

The engine should propose structured booking fields, show uncertainty/missing information and require human confirmation before writing Booking Core. AI must not silently invent booking facts.

### Notification delivery

The shared notification event stream now exists on staging. Delivery remains deliberately separate.

Preferred sequencing:

```text
email delivery from notifications
 -> in-product notification center using the same rows
 -> Web Push/PWA where justified
```

Do not emit independent email-only or push-only booking events.

### Internal Cuebooker admin / back office

Future internal admin should cover platform/user/workspace health, support/incidents, operational KPIs, email/webhook delivery, logs/correlation IDs, error diagnostics, abuse/rate limiting, alerts and audited admin actions.

Observability data should be captured incrementally now even though the admin UI is deferred.

### Friendly system feedback

Treat human feedback as a cross-product rule:

- field error -> explain the field problem;
- save/send success -> confirm clearly;
- retryable failure -> preserve work and explain next action;
- technical/provider detail -> logs/admin, not promoter-facing copy.

## 18. Root routing and static deployment

Root artist URLs under static Nuxt are resolved by `functions/[slug].js` on Cloudflare Pages. `ASSETS.fetch()` must use the pretty `/200` path rather than `/200.html`.

Previously validated:

- real artist slug -> HTTP 200 + artist metadata + Nuxt shell;
- missing slug -> 404;
- reserved `/workspace` -> application route, never artist resolution.

PR #75 remains the staging preview vehicle.

## 19. Security / operational follow-up

Before production:

- rotate Brevo API/webhook secrets exposed during setup;
- finish direct inbound email webhook smoke;
- strengthen anonymous rate/abuse protection for public intake and follow-up;
- perform visual desktop/mobile smoke of public profile, form, request page, distribution panel and widget;
- review CSP/frame policy for widget on external origins;
- run Supabase security/performance advisors;
- explicitly review production migrations/functions/deployment.

Existing project-level warning remains:

```text
Leaked Password Protection Disabled
```

Existing Edge Functions still use legacy `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`; migrate to the current Supabase secret-key model as a deliberate infrastructure task, not mixed into a product slice.

## 20. Exact next product work

Current sequencing is intentional:

```text
1. visually smoke Public Booking Form V2 desktop/mobile;
2. visually smoke new Distribution panel desktop/mobile;
3. fix UX regressions found in those smokes;
4. complete direct email reply webhook handshake when terminal access returns;
5. close/gate the public-entry block;
6. then open Smart Capture text + voice as a distinct feature block;
7. notification delivery E2E is proven on staging; visually smoke the notification center and real email presentation desktop/mobile;
8. commercial homepage/marketing redesign after operational product truth is strong enough to market honestly;
9. billing/trial enforcement after first external beta feedback, unless launch timing requires it earlier.
```

Do not jump ahead because downstream ideas are documented.

## 21. Documentation workflow rule

Every meaningful implementation block must finish by updating this handoff with:

- live functional commit;
- actual implementation state;
- validation and environment;
- remaining unverified work;
- exact next step;
- production state.

## 22. Production gate

Production Supabase:

```text
qlocooqfdzehogbwcbhr
```

No migration, Edge Function deployment, publication toggle or Cloudflare production release from this public-entry/follow-up work has been performed on production.

Remain staging-only until public-entry UX, direct inbound reply, abuse controls and explicit production review are complete.
